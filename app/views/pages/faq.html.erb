      <dt>Is UpDog secure?</dt>
      <dd>Yes! SSL certificates (https) are provided for all *.updog.co domains.
      We do not store or duplicate your content on our servers. When a request
      is made to UpDog, the request is forwarded directly to Dropbox to retrieve
      a file's contents. The only people who can see your content are those with
      whom you've shared an updog link.

      <dt>Will you help me set up a custom domain?</dt>
      <dd>Yes! Shoot me an email at jesse@updog.co</dd>

      <dt>Can I delete my account?</dt>
      <dd>You can revoke this application's access to your Dropbox
      account at any time by visiting <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/account/#apps'>https://www.dropbox.com/account/#apps</a>
      and clicking the "x" on the far right.</dd>
      <dt>Can I use an apex domain with UpDog?</dt>
      <dd>At this time, apex (or bare) domains are not supported with UpDog. You must use a subdomain, like www.
      With your domain registrar, you can forward bare domains to your updog domain: example.com -> www.example.com
